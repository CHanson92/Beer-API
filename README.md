# beer-api

----
## What is this project?


This was originally created as a project in RED Academy using HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript & jQuery. The purpose of the project was to create a website that showed beers from the Punk API.

I have modernised it to run as a Vue app using Vue-CLI.

### To run the project:
```
npm install
```
```
npm run start
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
